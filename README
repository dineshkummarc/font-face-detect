This script is a feature detection for the CSS3 feature of @font-face. This enables you to use a hosted font file as a font-family in your CSS.

My requirements for this detection were:

    * No browser userAgent sniffing
    * No extra HTTP request required
    * Must be performant with a small footprint, natch
    * Results should match the latest research on compatibility

This script is meant to replace all fontAvailable scripts. It can be asynchronous, but it has much greater accuracy.
